They resolved bigger issues with the flat roof so it now fully protects our home. We cannot thank them enough. Both roofs look amazing \u2014 the best looking in the street. Reliable, clean, kept us updated with videos/photos so we were aware of all stages of the roof replacement. 10/10 thank you!!"
